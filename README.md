## How to self host for free?

For image -> text translation, I went with gpt-4o. For answer generation, I've used claude 3.7 sonnet becauses it's the best. Both of these is easily changeable, and you can modify our own prompts too at backend/src/controllers

### Requirements

- Bun installed (https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- OpenAI API key
- Anthropic API key
- Supabase account (for auth and database). We need `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Also supabase CLI installed
- Docker (optional, for hosting backend)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/woaitsAryan/interview-coder-self-host
cd interview-coder-self-host

bun install
```

1. Create `.env` files and populate with the appropriate credentials

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
```

3. Login with your supabase CLI and do migrations

```bash
supabase login
supabase db push
```

4. Build the app for your platform

For this step, remember that whatever BACKEND_URL is in .env will be used as the backend url for the app. If you want to self-host it in a server, you'll have to change the URL and re-build this

```bash
bun run build
```

1. Run the backend

Either run it directly with bun:

```bash
bun run backend:dev
```

Or run it with docker:

```bash
bun run compose:build && bun run compose:up
```

6. Install the app

Go to releases/ folder and then find your .exe or .dmg or whatever and install it. 

On install, you'll see a sign in page, click on the sign-up button, I'd recommend to just disable email otp, so you can directly sign up with email. After sign-up, it will just work

That's it? yay! Do as you plesae!

### Some small caveats/issues you might experience:

- If you are running the app in dev using `bun run dev` so it'll open the developer console too by default so make sure to close that if you don't need it.
- I don't know how to close this app lol, I just go to process manager and kill it

## Invisibility Compatibility

The application is invisible to:

- Zoom versions below 6.1.6 (inclusive)
- All browser-based screen recording software

     - Problem requirements
     - Code context
   - System generates optimal solution strategy

4. **Solution & Debugging**

   - View generated solutions
   - Use debugging feature to:
     - Test different approaches
     - Fix errors in your code
     - Get line-by-line explanations
   - Toggle between solutions and queue views

5. **Window Management**
